If you are reporting a bug, please include: Your operating system name and version. Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting. Detailed steps to reproduce the bug. Fix Bugs \u00b6 Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with \"bug\" and \"help wanted\" is open to whoever wants to implement it. Implement Features \u00b6 Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with \"enhancement\" and \"help wanted\" is open to whoever wants to implement it. Write Documentation \u00b6 {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such. Submit Feedback \u00b6 The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.github_username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/issues. If you are proposing a feature: Explain in detail how it would work. Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.

Here's how to set up {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} for local development. Fork the {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} repo on GitHub. Clone your fork locally 1 $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.git Ensure poetry is installed. Install dependencies and start your virtualenv: 1 $ poetry install -E test -E doc -E dev Create a branch for local development: 1 $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature Now you can make your changes locally. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests, including testing other Python versions, with tox: 1 $ tox Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub: 1 2 3 $ git add . $ git commit -m \"Your detailed description of your changes.\" $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature Submit a pull request through the GitHub website. Pull Request Guidelines \u00b6 Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines: The pull request should include tests. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.md. The pull request should work for Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and for PyPy. Check https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.github_username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/actions and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
